How to use:

1) Manufacture the HDMI receiver board that can be found in 
   the 'board' directory (CADSoft Eagle format).
2) Open the 'fpga/hdmilight.xise' project in Xilinx ISE and
   generate a bit file.
3) Edit 'firmware/config_lights.h' to set light definitions.
4) Edit 'Makefile' in the top level directory and set
   the DATA2MEM path for the Xilinx data2mem tooli location
   on your system.
5) Run 'make' in the top level directory, which will build
   'tools/makemem', then the firmware image, then merge
   the firware image into the fpga bitfile.
   The final result should be hdmilight.bit in the top
   level directory.
6) Upload hdmilight.bit to a Papilio One 250K FPGA board
7) Install the HDMI receiver board on to the Papilio board.
8) Connect LED strips to output pins
9) Open a serial terminal to the Papilio
10) Give the command to initialise I2C: 
   I I
11) Give the command to configure the light definitions and 
   the ADV611 chip: 
   I C
12) Connect HDMI source to receiver board
13) It should now be working.
